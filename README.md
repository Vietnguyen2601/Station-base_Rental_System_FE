# EV Rental System - Optimized React Project Structure

## 📁 Project Structure Overview

This project follows a scalable, maintainable architecture designed for medium-to-large React applications with TypeScript and SCSS.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
- **Reusability**: Components designed for maximum reuse across features
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript integration
- **Testability**: Structure optimized for unit and integration testing
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without restructuring

## 📋 Directory Descriptions

### `/components`
Reusable UI components organized by purpose and complexity level.

### `/pages`
Route-level components that compose smaller components into full pages.

### `/hooks`
Custom React hooks for shared stateful logic and side effects.

### `/context`
React Context providers for global state management.

### `/services`
API integration layer and external service communications.

### `/utils`
Pure functions for data manipulation, formatting, and calculations.

### `/types`
Centralized TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.

### `/constants`
Application-wide constants, enums, and configuration values.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
4. Build for production: `npm run build`

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utilities and pure functions
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Integration tests for feature workflows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

## 📝 Code Organization Guidelines

- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Utilize TypeScript strict mode
- Apply SCSS modules for component styling# Station-base_Rental_System_FE
